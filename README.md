# PortfolioWebsite
How did you get here! 

This is my portfolio website that i built in 2022 for a school project. V2 is close to the final version I used in class however as of 12/30/23 this site is now on V3. There were a few pages that only existed due to the assignment requirements and i decided this site would be better as a single page then 3 or 4 pages. I also used this opertunity to rewrite a few things and esspecialy the 'slowPrint' script. This is certianly not the best show of my programming skill but it was writen in a single afternoon so take that as you'd like. Thanks for looking and hope you don't find too many atrocities.
