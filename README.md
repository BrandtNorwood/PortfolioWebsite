# PortfolioWebsite
How did you get here! 

This is my portfolio website that i built in 2022 for a school project. It's still loosly maintained and I do try to update it once and a while however the code in here is a horrible example of my abilities and I'd deffer to my Hangerlog project for a more complete picture. The cleanest example in there is the HangerRemap tool since it was writen with the most clear set of expectations I had during that project.
