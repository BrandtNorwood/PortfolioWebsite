            Hi! At the time of writing this I’m a sophomore in the Computer Science program at NDSU in Fargo. 
            I’ve been programming in my free time for the last few years and have picked up some skills in HTML/CSS/JS 
            (as this site should show you), C++ (very basic and mainly for arduino), and my main language, Java. I was introduced 
            to programming through the FIRST robotics team in my hometown high school. I was not on the programming team but as it 
            was a small team I spent a lot of time with the people who were and realized just how simple programming actually was and how much I enjoyed the work. 
            I’ve worked on a variety of projects demanding a variety of skills however my favorites are usually when i'm working with 
            a team or am given a wide open problem with room to solve. My employment history is quite short as I’ve held the same 
            position at my hometown Dairy Queen for four years! I liked the team and worked my way up to a supervisor position 
            which I held for a little over a year before moving to Fargo for school. I’m interested in a multitude of things from 
            music, to cars, to airplanes and avionics, and even rocketry. I’m always picking up new projects and hobbies and love 
            making things. I’m excited to break into this amazing field and create new things. I’m excited to learn and I'm excited 
            to be around other people with similar interests and thinking patterns. Most of all I’m excited to work in a job where I 
            enjoy the work!
