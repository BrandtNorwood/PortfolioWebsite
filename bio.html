        <h1>Some Info and Experience</h1>

        <p>  
           Hi! My Name is Brandt Norwood <br><br> I'm an intermediate developer with some skills in HTML, CSS, SQL,
            JavaScript, and Java! I also have some IT skills and have literally made a career out of it. My first ever
            computer was broken when I got it and that really set the tone for my life with tech. I love to create and
            experiment which is where my love of programming came from. I did two years at NDSU before having to drop out 
            due to financial and personal reasons however in this time I've gained valuable experience and even developed
            a small <a href="https://github.com/BrandtNorwood/HangerLog-FJC">web-based internal tool</a>a for my employer at the time.
            <br><br>
            I do apologize for the state of this website as I rarely update it and the majority of the bones of it are from
            a class project from 2021. Most of the work on my Github page is this old apart from the HangerLog project.
