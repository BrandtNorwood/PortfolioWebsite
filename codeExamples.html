            <br>
            While my first ever language was c++, I primaraly worked with arduinos so the first language
            I properly understood and worked with was Java. I have a few years of expeience mostly with
            simple programs and algorithems. However I'm not scared of a challenge and look forward to
            some interesting programing!

            As I hope you can see I do have minor experience with web development primaraly making iterations and improvments to
            this site! While I do enjoy it this is another area I'm still gaining experience in. I love server side development and have
            been working on discord bot development and other such things. I also have some expeirence in server hoasting as I have my own
            machines I remotely manage!
