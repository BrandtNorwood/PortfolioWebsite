                While my first ever language was c++, I primarily worked with Arduino, thus, my first language
                I properly understood and worked with Java. I have a few years of experience mostly with
                simple programs and algorithms. However, I'm not scared of a challenge and look forward to
                some interesting programming!

                While I'm no graphical designer I can make a functional page in HTML (as you can see here) and have used this skill to make a web app for an employer.
                While I do enjoy it this is another area I'm still gaining experience in. I also have some experience in server hosting as I have my own
                machines I remotely manage!

                <br>
                I'm pretty experienced in JS and have done some intermediate work with both this site but also a web-based application. This application ran JS both front
                and backend. The backend talks to a MySQL Server and is built to be as bulletproof as possible for zero downtime.
