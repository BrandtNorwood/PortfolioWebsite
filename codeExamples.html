            <p id="java"><Strong>Java, My Main Language</Strong><br>
                <br>
                While my first ever language was c++, I primaraly worked with arduinos so the first language
                I properly understood and worked with was Java. I have a few years of expeience mostly with
                simple programs and algorithems. However I'm not scared of a challenge and look forward to
                some interesting programing! 
            </p>

            <p id="html"><Strong>Html / CSS / JS</Strong><br>
                <br>
                As I hope you can see I do have minor experience with web development primaraly making iterations and improvments to
                this site! While I do enjoy it this is another area I'm still gaining experience in. I love server side development and have
                been working on discord bot development and other such things. I also have some expeirence in server hoasting as I have my own
                machines I remotely manage!
            </p>

            <p id="javaScript"><Strong>JavaScript</Strong><br>
                <br>
                I have some intermediate experience in this language and have used it to make things like the text effect on the landing page of this site. 
                I found it a weird but simple transition from java and do quite like JS for its simplicity and quick prototyping.
            </p>

            <p id="csharp"><Strong>C#</Strong><br>
                <br>
                While this is a new language to me it is one of my new favorites. I just recently started learning C# in an effort to become
                more prepared for the work enviroment. Since I'm familiar with C syntax this language has come easily to me. I've mostly done
                simple things and have yet to touch graphics but this is a language I'm very exited to learn due to its massive potential.
