        <h1>Hi! Im Brandt Norwood </h1>

        <h3>Im a Computer Sience student at NDSU in Fargo ND on my softmore year!</h3>

        <p>
            I have intermediate experience in Java and basic HTML/web development <i>(like this site)</i> but ultimately I'm looking to learn new skills and make things.
            I'm open to pretty much any decent paying job that lets me get into this amazing field and ultimately learn. 
            I currently live in the Fargo/Morehead and since I'm looking to complete my degree, I'm tied down.
            However, I'm very open to remote work as well as anything in the area. I have quite a bit of experience with teamwork
            and really enjoy it. For example I was a part of the Brainerd High School 2503 FIRST Robotics team for all 3 years I was eligible
            and eventually worked my way up to team lead!
        </p>

        <p>
            The list of jobs I've worked is short since I've spent the last four years at Dairy Queen in Brainerd. I stuck around and worked my way
            up to a supervisor position and worked 35-40 hour weeks. <i>DQ Contact Info TBA</i>

            code for this site by pushing F12!

            <br><small>No I will not do work for free but I know I'm new so I wont expect alot. Make me an offer!</small>
