                    I'm an intermediate developer with some skills in HTML, CSS, SQL,
                    JavaScript, and Java! I also work in IT and absolutly love it. My first ever
                    computer was broken when I got it so tech has always been something to tinker with and fix for me. I love to create and
                    experiment which is where my love of programming came from. I did two years at NDSU before having to drop out 
                    due to financial and personal reasons however in this time I've gained valuable experience and even developed
                    a small <a href="https://github.com/BrandtNorwood/HangerLog-FJC">web-based internal tool</a> for a previous employer.

            <h1>What Programming skills do I have?</h1>

            <p id="java"><Strong>Java</Strong><br>
                <br>
                While my first ever language was c++, I primarily worked with Arduino, thus, my first language
                I properly understood and worked with Java. I have a few years of experience mostly with
                simple programs and algorithms. However, I'm not scared of a challenge and look forward to
                some interesting programming! 
            </p>

            <p id="html" ><Strong>Html & CSS</Strong><br>
                <br>
                While I'm no graphical designer I can make a functional webpage (as you can see here) and I have even used this skill to make a web app for an employer.
                While I do enjoy it this is another area I'm still gaining experience in and rewriting this page recently I realized just how far I've come!
            </p>

                <br>
                I'm pretty experienced in JS and have done some intermediate work with both this site but also a web-based application. This application ran JS both front
                and backend. The backend talks to a MySQL Server and is built to be as bulletproof as possible for zero downtime.
            </p>

            <p id="cpp"><strong>C++</strong><br>
                <br>
                At the time of writing this I'm just picking this language back up to play with the SDL2 library. I'd definatly consider myself a beginer in C++ due to my
                lack of understanding of memory managment however due to my experience in other C type languages I'm finding it rather comfortable so far.
